## Hello World!

I'm **Marin Becker**, a student at [**42 Paris**](https://42.fr) where I began my journey in November 2023.

💻 After completing 42's common core, I’m currently working on **full-stack projects**, building web apps from scratch while preparing to **specialize in DevOps**.

🚀 I’m about to start my **first internship** as a full-stack developer, following several months of hands-on learning and project work.

✌️ When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me getting strangled on the mats in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or laying down some questionable basslines in my room :)
