## Hello World!

I'm **Marin Becker**, a student at 42 Paris where I started my cursus in November 2023. 

📚 I'm currently learning C through 42's projects to gain deep and useful programming skills. During my spare time, I'm also learning web development by coding my own personal website. 

🧑🏻‍💻 My goal is to eventually end up a full stack dev, but I'm also interested in discovering the fields of  cybersecurity and devops.  

✌️ Apart from work, I love creating awful melodies on the bass and getting my butt kicked by black belts in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu!
