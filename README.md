## Hello World!

I'm **Marin Becker**, a student at 42 Paris where I started my cursus in November 2023. 

📚 I’ve completed all my **C** projects at 42 and am now working on **C++** and general **IT** projects. During my spare time, I'm also learning **web development** and **system administration** by coding and maintaining my own personal website from scratch. 

🧑🏻‍💻 My goal is to eventually work in as a devops engineer.  

✌️ Apart from work, I love creating awful melodies on the bass and getting my butt kicked by black belts in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu!
