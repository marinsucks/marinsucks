## Hello World!

I'm **Marin Becker**, a student at 42 Paris where I began my journey in November 2023.

📚 I’ve completed all my **C** and **C++** projects, and I’m now diving into new technologies with a focus on **DevOps** and **full-stack development**. In my free time, I explore system administration and web development by building and maintaining my own personal website from scratch.

🧑🏻‍💻 I’m currently looking for my **first internship** in DevOps or full-stack development to gain hands-on experience and level up my skills.

✌️ When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me getting strangled on the mats in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or laying down some questionable basslines in my room :)
